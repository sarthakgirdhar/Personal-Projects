## Improving Toronto Police's Crime dashboards and providing some additional actionable recommendations

In this project, I improve the [Break & Enter - Temporal Trends](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/break-and-enter) dashboard (page 2) in Power BI to make it more user-friendly and less cluttered. 

The dataset is obtained from the Toronto Police's [open data](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/search?tags=break%20&%20enter,break%20and%20enter). 

And the Power BI file can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/sarthakgirdhar/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Work%20for%20Toronto%20Police/B&E_Toronto.pbix). 

There are also some additional actionable suggestions provided to improve the **Analytics & Innovation** and **Neighbourhood Community Officer** programs. The entire report can be read [here](https://github.com/sarthakgirdhar/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Work%20for%20Toronto%20Police/Recommendations%20to%20improve%20Toronto%20Police%27s%20programs.pdf). 

Finally, I also provide a [business use case](https://github.com/sarthakgirdhar/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Work%20for%20Toronto%20Police/Lessons%20learned%20from%202022%20Vaughan%20shooting.png) to improve Community Safety and Well-Being in residential condominiums ignited by the 2022 Vaughan shooting incident.
