## Yelp Review Modifications

This project uses R to analyze Yelp's data to tweak their rating system in order to make it easier to pick good Indian restaurants. I tried two different ways to accomplish the above.

### Method 1 - Give more weight to frequent reviewers 

This means if someone had reviewed 2 different Indian restaurants, their rating was given a 2x weight, 3 different restaurants meant 3x, etc.

### Method 2 - Modifying restaurant reviews to only the native Indian users

This creates a separate rating in Yelp based on reviewers who had Indian names.
