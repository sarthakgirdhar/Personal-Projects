## Airline Delay and Airport Performance

In this project, I look into flight delay reasons across USA. The [dataset](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ot_delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp?20=E) is obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. 

### About the data

 1. Flights arriving more than 15 minutes late or more are counted as official delays.
 2. The five delay reasons include - carrier delay, weather delay, NAS delay, late aircraft delay, and security delay.
 3. Only 8 carriers/airlines have been reporting all the delay data in the past 10 years.

### Dashboards

The scope of data for the two dashboards is Jan 2013 to Aug 2023. The various metrics visualized on the dashboards are listed below.

**Airline Delay**
	
 - Average carrier delay in minutes from 2013 to 2023.
 - YoY % change for the 8 airlines.
- Count of delayed flights due to carrier VS other reasons (late aircraft, weather, NAS, security).

	
**Airport Performance**

 - Average arrival delay (in minutes) for the selected airport from 2013 to 2023.
 - Percentage of delayed flights from 2013 to 2023 for the selected airport.
 - Breakdown of flight delay reasons.
- Count of Total Flights, Delayed Flights and Delayed Flights % (till date as well as separately for each individual year).
- 2022 Average delay (in minutes).
- 2022 Airport Ranking (out of 373 airports). 

### Skills demonstrated

 - Understanding dataset and reading supporting documentation.
 - Checking for data quality and transformations in Power Query/M.
 - Data Modeling (fact & dimension tables, star schema, surrogate keys, SCD).
 - Data analysis - answering stakeholderâ€™s questions via dashboards.
 - DAX calculations to create new measures, tables, and columns. 
 - Visualizations (line chart, bar chart, donut chart, card visuals, text boxes, conditional sub-headings, action-based buttons, icons as buttons, use of tooltips, accessible theme, etc.)
