##Water Pumps Challenge

This project predicts which water pumps throughout Tanzania are functional, which need some repairs, and which do not work at all based on a number of variables. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.
