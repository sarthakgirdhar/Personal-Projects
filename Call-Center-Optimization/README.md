## Call Center Optimization

This mini project helps in finding out how many representatives are required in a call center to ensure **0** wait time for all its customers.

### Data provided

1. 10k calls are made in a single day (1440 minutes).
2. The **Duration of calls** is in *minutes*.
3. **Time** is the *time* (in minutes) from 00:00 midnight.
4. **Call** represents the *ID* of the customer.
5. All reps have the same efficiency.
6. Assume that no breaks were taken by the caller and, individual caller is available for entire 24 hours. Note that the data is only for a single day (1440 minutes).
